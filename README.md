# experience-builder-app

The main folder in the master branch stores my original Experience Builder Developer Edition App with custom widgets.

The my-updates branch is used to store any updated version. Currently storing v2 as the most recent.

gh-pages branch is used to host the most recent version of the app on my github page.
